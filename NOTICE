FreeMarker

The following software may be included in this product.
- org.freemarker:freemarker

This software contains the following license and notice below:

===========================================================================

Apache FreeMarker
Copyright 2015-2016 The Apache Software Foundation

This product includes software developed at
The Apache Software Foundation (http://www.apache.org/).

===========================================================================

FreeMarker, both in its source code and binary form (freemarker.jar)
includes files that were developed outside the FreeMarker project, and
are licensed by the Apache Software Foundation under the Apache License,
Version 2.0. This is the same license as the license of FreeMaker. These
files in the FreeMarker binary (inside the jar file) are:
  
    freemarker/ext/jsp/web-app_2_2.dtd
    freemarker/ext/jsp/web-app_2_3.dtd
    freemarker/ext/jsp/web-jsptaglibrary_1_1.dtd
    freemarker/ext/jsp/web-jsptaglibrary_1_2.dtd

===========================================================================

Apache FreeMarker is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache
Software Foundation (ASF). Incubation is required of all newly accepted
projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure,
communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner
consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is
not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by
the ASF.
